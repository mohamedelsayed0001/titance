# Titanic-ML

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, class, etc.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to apply different machine learning techniques to the well-known Titanic dataset to predict the survival of passengers. this my first submission for the "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" competition on Kaggle has been accepted! ðŸš¢âœ¨
